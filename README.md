# VigDecrypt
Learnt about Kasiski's method to decrypt the Vigenere Cipher in a math course and I thought it would be something good to make into a little program. 

### Currently Working:
Using Kasiski's method to find keylength based on cipher text

### To do:
Implement automatic decryption using Kasiki's key length as starting point.
